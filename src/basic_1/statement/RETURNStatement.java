/**
 * The RETURN statement.
 *
 * The RETURN statement transfers control to the first statement following the
 * last GOSUB to be executed. Note that if the GOSUB used a colon to combine
 * statements on a line, it is that statement that control returns to.
 *
 * Syntax: RETURN
 *
 * Syntax Errors: Extra stuff past the end of the statement.
 *
 * Runtime Errors: Return without GOSUB.
